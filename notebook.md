Basic idea:
If you look at one electron moving in a solid, and look at its wavefunction carefully using topological concepts, you can explain a number of experiments.
This was a 30-year project in the theory of solids, and a lot of changes have happened in the last 10 years.

There are many ways to approach the topology of electrons in a solid. One way is in terms of the Berry phase. 

Basic idea of Berry phase in quantym systems: 
- IQHE
- Topological Insulators



First solids where we think that the lower energy description of the electron is the free Weyl and Dirac fermions 
Recent work in metals: explain previously puzzling optical effects. Originally motivated by Kapitulnik et al work on cuprates. Relevant to newly discovered Weyl and Dirac semimetals (Shudan Zhong, JEM, I. Souza arXiv)

## Definition of Topological Phases of Matter.

Topological state: something where some property we care about is insensitive to smooth deformations such as slightly changing the material.

Weyl fermions and Dirac fermions are two different ways of taking "half" of the Dirac equation in 3D. We think we've found the Weyl material, and we're actively looking for Majorana materials.

## Types of Order

## Symmetry breaking.
If we take a crystal and zoom in, we'll get a lattice. It could be about a million atoms without a defect. The lattice has symmetry, translational and rotational. However, it has fewer symmetries than the vacuum. Because the lattice is in the vacuum, we can classify crystals by which symmetries of the vacuum were broken. We can do the same for liquid crystams (computer displays, magnets), even for superfluids (quantum mechanical symmetry breaking). 

- Crystals: break the translational and rotational symmetries of free space.
- Liquid crystals in a LCD break the rotational, but not the translational symmetry.
- Magnets break time-reversal symmetry and the rotational symmetry of spin space.
- Superfluids break an internal symmetry of quantum mechanics. 

These symmetry breakings lead to ordered phases predictions, in addition with microscopic theories such as Mean-field-theory (Jonathan). 

WHAT'S ABOVE IS WHAT TOPOLOGICAL ORDER IS NOT.


In 1980, the first ordered phase beyond symmetry breaking was discovered in the Hall experiment (cite hall). The Hall experiment could be performed by capturing electrons into a planar (or 2D) material, and placing the material in a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the electrons plane. By how much you can bend the electrons, you can figure out how many charge carriers are there in the plane, and whether the carriers are electrons (negatively charged) or holes (positively charged)

The way it typically works is that there is a smooth dependence on the magnetic field of the so-called Hall or off-diagonal resistance. Around 1980, people started doing this experiment on 2D electron gases. At a sufficiently low temperature (find the temperature, Thouless' book), one starts to observe plateaus in the HALL conductivity ($$\sigma_xy$$).



## The Quantum Hall 

With a chunck of electrons in a 2D metal, one of the basic experiments done on it is the Hall effect which goes back to the 1890's. 
Von Kitzling discovered the first ordered phase beyond symmetry breaking in 1980 (cite article). Electrons confined to a plane, in a strong B-field (cyclotron motion) and low temperature (see paper) show quantized $\rho_{yx}$ resistivity, i.e plateaus in $\sigma_{xy}$ conductivity in units of $\dfrac{e^{2}}{h}$.

This measurement was good to 1 part in $10^{9}$. For a few years this was our best way of measuring $\dfrac{e^{2}}{h}$. The Josephson effect (cite) is another measurement that gives us the fine structure constant $\alpha$; and this measurement was as good as the Josephson effect's measurements. The reason why this was surprising is because it's an imperfect metal with defects, and yet the measurements were able to extract the accurate value of $\alpha$.

## LANDAU LEVELS

Traditional picture: Landau levels
Normally the Hall ratio is (here n is a density)
Ix 1 nec
RH = = VyB
nec
) xy =
B
   Then the value (now n is an integer) e2
σxy = n h
corresponds to an areal density
This is exactly the density of “Landau levels”, the discrete spectrum of eigenstates of a 2D particle in an orbital magnetic field, spaced by the cyclotron energy. The only “surprise” is how precise the quantization is.
= neB/hc.

(THERE ARE FRACTIONAL PLATEAUS!!)

Q: what type of order cause this precise quantization? A topological order.
> It doesn't matter what material is used to make the measurement. GaAs, InAs, Graphene, we get the same number. $\sigma_{xy}$ is still quantized in units of $\dfrac{e^{2}}{h}$.



## Topological Invariants


How do we understand the discoveries?

Topological Invariants in Physics:
In a topologically ordered phase, some physical response function is given by a "topological invariant".

What is a topological invariant?

A topological phase is insulating, but always has a **metallic edge/surcafe** when next to a vacuum or an ordinary phase. 

A topological invariant is a quantity that does not change under continuous deformation. 
most of the topological invariants in physics are obtained by integrating something that has a local meaning.

At every point there is a curvature
