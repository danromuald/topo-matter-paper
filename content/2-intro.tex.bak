\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}
The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016 was sahared among David J.Thouless ($\frac{1}{2}$ of the prize), F. Duncan Haldane ($\frac{1}{4}$ of the prize), and J. Michael Korstelitz ($\frac{1}{4}$ of the prize), for \textit{"theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter"}. The Nobel prize rewarded Thouless and Haldane for their contributions in understanding topological phases of matter, and rewarded Korstelitz and Thouless for their contributions to understanding topological phase transitions. The idea could be simplified as: looking at an electron moving in a solid and exploring its wavefunction using topological concepts, one can explain a number of experiments. KT.
